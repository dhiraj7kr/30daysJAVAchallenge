### 1. Introduction to Programming
In this section, we introduce the fundamental concepts of programming. Topics such as variables, data types, operators, control flow structures (like loops and conditionals), and basic syntax are covered. The focus is on developing problem-solving skills and a strong understanding of how programs are executed.

### 2. Flow of Program
Understanding how a program flows is essential. We cover concepts like sequential execution, decision-making (if-else), loops, and function calls. Additionally, we explain the program lifecycle and debugging techniques to trace and correct program flow.

### 3. Introduction to Java
This section introduces Java, a powerful, widely-used programming language. Topics include the basics of setting up Java, writing simple programs, understanding Java syntax, and familiarizing oneself with Java’s object-oriented nature.

### 4. Functions / Methods
Functions (or methods) allow us to structure our code into reusable blocks. We explore the importance of functions, parameters, return types, and scope. Understanding how to design efficient functions is key to clean and modular code.

### 5. Arrays and ArrayList
Arrays and ArrayLists are essential data structures in Java. We explain the differences between these two, how to declare, initialize, and manipulate them, and when to use one over the other for better performance.

### 6. Searching
Searching algorithms help us locate elements within a dataset. In this section, we cover basic search algorithms like linear search and binary search, along with when to use each one depending on the problem.

### 7. Sorting
Sorting is a critical skill in programming. We cover popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others, discussing their time complexity and use cases.

### 8. Time and Space Complexity
This section introduces Big O notation, which is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. We explore how to calculate the time and space complexity of algorithms and understand trade-offs between them.

### 9. Mathematics
Mathematical concepts play a crucial role in programming. Here, we cover topics like number theory, prime numbers, combinatorics, and how they relate to algorithm design and optimization.

### 10. Recursion
Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve a problem. We explain how recursion works, strategies to master it, and its applications in problems like tree traversal, string processing, and more.

  - **How to Master Recursion:** Key strategies for breaking down problems into smaller subproblems.
  - **Tail Recursion:** Optimizing recursion for performance.
  - **Sorting, String, Array, Pattern, Subset Problems:** Practical applications of recursion.

### 11. Backtracking
Backtracking is a powerful problem-solving technique used in puzzles, optimization problems, and more. We discuss its core principles and how it’s applied to problems like the N-Queens problem and Sudoku.

### 12. Object-Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm used to structure software. We cover the four pillars of OOP—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—and explain their application in Java.

### 13. Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes. This section covers the various types of linked lists (singly, doubly), operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, and their use in building efficient data structures.

### 14. Stacks and Queues
Stacks and queues are abstract data structures that store data in a specific order. We discuss their LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) properties, common operations, and their applications in algorithms like expression evaluation and scheduling.

### 15. Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures used in a wide range of applications. This section includes the basics of tree structure, types of trees (binary trees, AVL trees, etc.), tree traversal, and use cases like decision trees and file systems.

### 16. Hashmaps
Hashmaps (or Hash Tables) are used to store key-value pairs for efficient lookups. We cover how hashmaps work, hash functions, collisions, and practical uses like counting frequencies and implementing caches.

### 17. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems. This section covers techniques like memoization and tabulation, and how to apply them to problems like the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack, and longest common subsequence.

### 18. Heaps
A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. We explore binary heaps (max-heap and min-heap), heap operations (insertion, deletion), and their use in algorithms like heap sort and priority queues.

### 19. Graph Theory
Graph theory is a fundamental topic in computer science, dealing with networks and relationships between entities. This section covers graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal techniques (BFS, DFS), and algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path and topological sorting.

### 20. Additional Topics
This section may include other advanced topics such as:

- Bit Manipulation
- String Matching Algorithms
- Advanced Data Structures (Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)
- Multi-threading and Concurrency
- Machine Learning Basics
