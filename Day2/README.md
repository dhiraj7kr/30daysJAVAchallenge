**Example Input:**  
Array: [3, 5, 1, 9, 2]  

**Expected Output:**  
Second Largest Element: 5  

---

### **9. Frequency of Elements**
**Question:**  
Write a program to find the frequency of each element in an array.

**Example Input:**  
Array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1]  

**Expected Output:**  
Frequency:  
1 -> 3 times
