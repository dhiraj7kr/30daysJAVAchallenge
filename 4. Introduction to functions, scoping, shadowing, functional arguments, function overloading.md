In Java, functions (referred to as **methods**) are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to write reusable code and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Let's dive into each concept you mentioned with examples and explanations.

### 1. **Introduction to Functions/Methods in Java**

A **method** in Java is a set of instructions that are executed when the method is called. Methods are defined within a class and can either return a value (non-void) or perform an action (void).

#### Syntax to declare a method:
```java
return_type method_name(parameters) {
    // method body
}
```

- **return_type**: This defines what type of value the method will return (e.g., `int`, `String`, `void` for no return).
- **method_name**: The name of the method.
- **parameters**: (Optional) The inputs to the method (can be zero or more).

#### Example:
```java
public class Main {
    // A method with no return type (void)
    public static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    // A method with a return type
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        greet(); // calling the method greet
        int sum = add(5, 3); // calling the method add
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Scoping in Java**

**Scoping** refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and methods within different parts of the code. In Java, the scope of a variable depends on where it is declared (inside a method, inside a class, etc.).

#### Types of scopes:
- **Local Variables**: Variables declared inside a method. They are only accessible within that method.
- **Instance Variables**: Variables declared inside a class but outside of methods. They are tied to an object.
- **Class Variables**: Declared with the `static` keyword. They belong to the class rather than instances of the class.

#### Example of scoping:
```java
public class ScopingExample {
    int instanceVar = 10; // Instance variable

    public void method1() {
        int localVar = 5; // Local variable
        System.out.println("Instance Variable: " + instanceVar); 
        System.out.println("Local Variable: " + localVar);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScopingExample obj = new ScopingExample();
        obj.method1(); // calling method1
    }
}
```
- `localVar` can only be accessed inside `method1`, whereas `instanceVar` can be accessed by any method in the class.

### 3. **Shadowing in Java**

**Shadowing** occurs when a local variable has the same name as an instance variable. The local variable "shadows" or hides the instance variable within its scope (the method).

#### Example of shadowing:
```java
public class ShadowingExample {
    int x = 10; // instance variable

    public void method1() {
        int x = 5; // local variable, shadows the instance variable
        System.out.println("Local variable x: " + x); // prints 5
        System.out.println("Instance variable x: " + this.x); // prints 10 (using 'this' to refer to instance variable)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShadowingExample obj = new ShadowingExample();
        obj.method1();
    }
}
```
Here, `x` inside the method shadows the `x` instance variable. You can access the instance variable using `this.x`.

### 4. **Functional Arguments (Passing Arguments to Methods)**

In Java, you can pass data (arguments) to methods either by **value** or **reference**:

- **Primitive Data Types** (e.g., `int`, `double`): Passed by value.
- **Objects** (e.g., `String`, custom classes): Passed by reference, meaning changes to the object inside the method affect the original object.

#### Example:
```java
public class FunctionArgsExample {

    public static void changeValue(int a) {
        a = 20; // Modifies the local copy of a
    }

    public static void changeReference(StringBuilder sb) {
        sb.append(" World!"); // Modifies the object sb points to
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        changeValue(x);
        System.out.println("x after changeValue: " + x); // x remains 10 because primitive types are passed by value

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        changeReference(sb);
        System.out.println("sb after changeReference: " + sb); // sb changes to "Hello World!" because objects are passed by reference
    }
}
```

### 5. **Function Overloading in Java**

**Function Overloading** in Java allows you to define multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter lists (either in number, type, or both). The method signature must be different for overloading to work.

#### Example of method overloading:
```java
public class MethodOverloadingExample {

    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MethodOverloadingExample obj = new MethodOverloadingExample();
        
        System.out.println("Sum of two integers: " + obj.add(5, 3));
        System.out.println("Sum of three integers: " + obj.add(5, 3, 2));
        System.out.println("Sum of two doubles: " + obj.add(5.5, 3.5));
    }
}
```
In this example, the `add` method is overloaded with different parameters (two integers, three integers, and two doubles).

### Key Points Recap:
- **Methods**: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Scoping**: Defines the accessibility of variables and methods based on their declaration.
- **Shadowing**: When a local variable hides or "shadows" an instance variable with the same name.
- **Functional Arguments**: Passing values or objects to methods. Primitive types are passed by value, and objects are passed by reference.
- **Function Overloading**: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.

### Java Question:

You are tasked with implementing a system to calculate discounts for various customer types in a retail application. In your program, you define a function `calculateDiscount` that computes discounts based on customer type and their total purchase amount. You also want to explore how scoping, shadowing, function arguments, and overloading can be utilized effectively.

1. **Function Basics:**  
   Write a basic version of the `calculateDiscount` method that takes two arguments: `customerType` (a `String`) and `totalAmount` (a `double`). The method should return a discount amount based on the `customerType`. Consider two customer types: "Regular" and "VIP". Regular customers get a 5% discount, and VIP customers get a 10% discount.

2. **Scoping:**  
   Define a class-level (global) variable `discountRate` and use it inside the method to adjust the discount rate based on some global condition (e.g., a store-wide sale).

3. **Shadowing:**  
   Inside the `calculateDiscount` method, declare a local variable `discountRate` and show how it shadows the class-level variable. What will happen if you change the local `discountRate`?

4. **Function Arguments:**  
   Modify the `calculateDiscount` method to accept an additional argument `isOnSale` (a `boolean`). If the store is having a sale, apply an additional 5% discount on top of the customer's discount. How would you use this argument to alter the discount logic?

5. **Function Overloading:**  
   Create a new version of the `calculateDiscount` method that takes three arguments: `customerType`, `totalAmount`, and `loyaltyPoints` (an `int`). The method should apply an extra 2% discount for customers with more than 100 loyalty points. Demonstrate how function overloading can be used to create multiple versions of this method with different parameters.

### Example Code Outline (in Java):

```java
public class DiscountCalculator {

    // Class-level (global) discountRate
    static double discountRate = 0.05; // Default for regular customers

    // Basic version of calculateDiscount
    public static double calculateDiscount(String customerType, double totalAmount) {
        if (customerType.equals("VIP")) {
            discountRate = 0.10; // VIP customers get a 10% discount
        } else {
            discountRate = 0.05; // Regular customers get a 5% discount
        }

        return totalAmount * discountRate;
    }

    // Method demonstrating scoping and shadowing
    public static double calculateDiscountWithSale(String customerType, double totalAmount, boolean isOnSale) {
        // Local variable that shadows the class-level discountRate
        double discountRate = 0.05; // Default for regular customers

        if (customerType.equals("VIP")) {
            discountRate = 0.10; // VIP customers get a 10% discount
        }

        if (isOnSale) {
            discountRate += 0.05; // Additional 5% discount if on sale
        }

        return totalAmount * discountRate;
    }

    // Function overloading: Adding loyaltyPoints parameter
    public static double calculateDiscount(String customerType, double totalAmount, int loyaltyPoints) {
        double discountRate = 0.05; // Default for regular customers

        if (customerType.equals("VIP")) {
            discountRate = 0.10; // VIP customers get a 10% discount
        }

        if (loyaltyPoints > 100) {
            discountRate += 0.02; // Extra 2% discount for loyal customers
        }

        return totalAmount * discountRate;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the basic method
        System.out.println(calculateDiscount("VIP", 1000)); // Expected output: 100.0 (VIP discount)

        // Test the method with sale
        System.out.println(calculateDiscountWithSale("Regular", 1000, true)); // Expected output: 105.0 (Regular + Sale)

        // Test the method with loyalty points
        System.out.println(calculateDiscount("VIP", 1000, 150)); // Expected output: 120.0 (VIP + Loyalty points)
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Basics:**  
   - The `calculateDiscount` method calculates the discount based on the customer type. Regular customers get a 5% discount, and VIP customers get a 10% discount.

2. **Scoping:**  
   - The global variable `discountRate` is defined at the class level. However, inside the method `calculateDiscountWithSale`, the local `discountRate` variable is used. This demonstrates how the local variable can shadow the global variable.

3. **Shadowing:**  
   - In the `calculateDiscountWithSale` method, we declare a local variable `discountRate` which shadows the class-level `discountRate`. Changing the local `discountRate` does not affect the global variable.

4. **Function Arguments:**  
   - The `isOnSale` argument is used to adjust the discount rate by an additional 5% if true. This showcases how the function arguments affect the logic within the method.

5. **Function Overloading:**  
   - The `calculateDiscount` method is overloaded to accept three arguments: `customerType`, `totalAmount`, and `loyaltyPoints`. If the `loyaltyPoints` exceed 100, an extra 2% discount is applied. This shows how function overloading allows you to define different methods with the same name but different parameters.

### Follow-Up Questions:
- What happens when you call `calculateDiscount("VIP", 1000)` versus `calculateDiscount("Regular", 1000, 150)`?
- How would you modify the code to ensure that the global discount rate (`discountRate`) is always used unless overridden by local values in specific methods?
