### 1. **Introduction to Programming**
Programming is the process of designing and building executable computer software to accomplish a specific task. It involves writing code in a programming language that the computer can understand and execute. The goal of programming is to solve problems and automate tasks by giving the computer a set of instructions.

**Key Concepts in Programming:**
- **Syntax:** The rules that define the structure of a programming language.
- **Algorithms:** Step-by-step instructions for solving a problem.
- **Data Structures:** Ways of organizing and storing data.
- **Variables:** Storage locations in the memory that hold data.
- **Functions/Methods:** Blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

**Example (Java):**
Here's a simple Java program that outputs a message.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");  // Prints a message to the console
    }
}
```

In this program:
- `public class HelloWorld` defines a class.
- `public static void main(String[] args)` is the main method where the program starts.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` prints the message to the console.

### 2. **Types of Programming Languages**

Programming languages can be categorized based on their abstraction level and their design.

#### a. **High-Level Languages:**
These are closer to human languages and abstract away the hardware complexities. They are easier to read and write but less efficient in terms of performance. Examples include Java, Python, C#, and Ruby.

**Example (Java)**:
```java
int x = 10;
```
This is easier to understand, and you don’t need to worry about how the computer stores the value.

#### b. **Low-Level Languages:**
These are closer to machine code (binary) and give the programmer more control over hardware. These languages include Assembly and Machine language. They are harder to read and write but more efficient.

#### c. **Procedural Programming Languages:**
These focus on a sequence of steps (procedures) to solve a problem. Example languages include C, Java (when used in a procedural manner), and Python.

#### d. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages:**
OOP languages, like Java, Python, and C++, use objects and classes to organize code. OOP focuses on using objects that contain both data and methods to interact with that data.

**Java Example:**
```java
class Dog {
    String name;

    // Method
    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }
}
```

Here, `Dog` is a class, and `bark()` is a method.

#### e. **Functional Programming Languages:**
These languages emphasize functions and immutability, with less focus on changing states. Examples include Haskell, Scala, and JavaScript (to an extent).

### 3. **Memory Management**

Memory management refers to the process of managing a computer's memory resources. Proper memory management ensures that the memory is used efficiently and prevents issues such as memory leaks and memory overflows.

In Java, memory management is automatic because of **Garbage Collection**. However, the programmer must still manage memory allocation and deallocation to some extent.

#### Key Concepts in Memory Management:
- **Memory Allocation:** When a program runs, memory is allocated for variables, objects, and data structures.
- **Heap Memory:** This is used for dynamic memory allocation where objects are stored.
- **Stack Memory:** This is used for storing method calls, local variables, and control flow during the execution of a program.
- **Garbage Collection (GC):** A process that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use (i.e., objects that are no longer referenced).

#### Example of Garbage Collection in Java:
```java
public class MemoryManagementExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyObject obj = new MyObject();
        obj = null; // Now, obj is eligible for garbage collection
        System.gc(); // Requests the JVM to perform garbage collection
    }
}

class MyObject {
    // Class implementation
}
```

In the example above, the object `obj` is set to `null`, making it eligible for garbage collection. The `System.gc()` method requests the JVM to perform garbage collection, though the JVM may handle this in its own time.

#### Memory Management in Java:
1. **Automatic Memory Management:** Java handles memory allocation and garbage collection.
2. **Garbage Collector (GC):** It frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer needed. This prevents memory leaks (when memory that is no longer used isn't released).

In **C/C++**, memory management is manual:
- You allocate memory using `malloc` or `new` and release it using `free` or `delete`.

**Example in C++:**
```cpp
int* ptr = new int;  // Allocate memory
*ptr = 10;
delete ptr;  // Free the memory
```

### **Real-Life Example Question**

**Scenario:**  
Imagine you are building a simple inventory system for a store. You need to write a Java program to keep track of products, each with a name and quantity, and allow users to add or remove items from the inventory.

1. **What kind of data structure would you use to store the products in the inventory?**
2. **How would you ensure the inventory data is kept consistent (e.g., managing inventory updates and memory)?**
   
**Answer Example (Java)**:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class InventorySystem {
    private HashMap<String, Integer> inventory;

    public InventorySystem() {
        inventory = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addProduct(String name, int quantity) {
        inventory.put(name, inventory.getOrDefault(name, 0) + quantity);
    }

    public void removeProduct(String name, int quantity) {
        if (inventory.containsKey(name)) {
            int currentQuantity = inventory.get(name);
            if (currentQuantity > quantity) {
                inventory.put(name, currentQuantity - quantity);
            } else {
                inventory.remove(name);  // Remove product if quantity goes to 0
            }
        }
    }

    public void showInventory() {
        for (String name : inventory.keySet()) {
            System.out.println("Product: " + name + ", Quantity: " + inventory.get(name));
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InventorySystem system = new InventorySystem();
        system.addProduct("Apples", 100);
        system.addProduct("Bananas", 50);
        system.removeProduct("Apples", 20);
        system.showInventory();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- We use a `HashMap` to store product names and their respective quantities.
- `addProduct()` method adds a product to the inventory, increasing its quantity.
- `removeProduct()` method removes a specific quantity of a product or removes the product entirely when the quantity reaches zero.
- `showInventory()` prints the current list of products.

This example addresses memory management by utilizing Java’s built-in memory management and garbage collection for managing the `HashMap` and any objects.
