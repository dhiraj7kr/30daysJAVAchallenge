### 1. **Linear Search**

Linear search is one of the simplest search algorithms. It checks each element in a list sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list.

#### **How Linear Search Works:**
1. Start at the first element in the array.
2. Compare the element with the target value.
3. If the element matches the target, return the index.
4. If the element does not match, move to the next element and repeat the process.
5. If you reach the end of the list and haven't found the target, return `-1` (indicating the target is not present).

#### **Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1) (If the target is the first element)
- Worst Case: O(n) (If the target is the last element or not present at all)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (Constant space)

#### **Example (Java - Linear Search):**
```java
public class LinearSearch {
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i;  // Return index if found
            }
        }
        return -1;  // Return -1 if target is not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {5, 2, 9, 1, 7};
        int target = 9;
        int result = linearSearch(arr, target);
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Element found at index: 2
```

### 2. **Binary Search**

Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on **sorted arrays**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, making it much faster than Linear Search. 

#### **How Binary Search Works:**
1. Start with the middle element of the sorted array.
2. If the middle element is the target, return its index.
3. If the target is smaller than the middle element, narrow the search to the left half of the array.
4. If the target is greater than the middle element, narrow the search to the right half.
5. Repeat the process until the target is found or the subarray has no more elements.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- Best Case: O(1) (If the target is the middle element)
- Worst Case: O(log n) (Each iteration halves the search space)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (Iterative implementation) or O(log n) (Recursive implementation)

#### **Example (Java - Binary Search):**
```java
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid;  // Return index if found
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;  // Search in the right half
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;  // Search in the left half
            }
        }

        return -1;  // Return -1 if target is not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9};
        int target = 7;
        int result = binarySearch(arr, target);
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Element found at index: 3
```

### 3. **Modified Binary Search**

Modified Binary Search is a variation of the standard Binary Search. It is used when the array is **not sorted** but still has some structure or pattern that can be exploited.

Common variations of modified binary search include:
- **Search in a rotated sorted array** (where the array is rotated at a pivot, e.g., `[6, 7, 9, 15, 19, 2, 3]`).
- **Finding the first occurrence of a target in a sorted array with duplicates.**
- **Finding the minimum or maximum in a rotated sorted array.**

Let's discuss a **Modified Binary Search** for a **rotated sorted array**, where the array has been rotated at an unknown pivot.

#### **Modified Binary Search (Rotated Array)**

**How It Works:**
1. We start by finding the middle element, just like in regular Binary Search.
2. If the middle element is smaller than the right element, the right half is sorted, and the left half is unsorted.
3. If the middle element is larger than the right element, the left half is sorted, and the right half is unsorted.
4. Based on the target value, we adjust our search boundaries accordingly.

#### **Example (Java - Modified Binary Search in Rotated Sorted Array):**
```java
public class ModifiedBinarySearch {
    public static int searchInRotatedArray(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid;  // Return index if target is found
            }

            // Check if the left half is sorted
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                if (target >= arr[low] && target < arr[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1;  // Search in the left half
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;  // Search in the right half
                }
            }
            // Else, the right half is sorted
            else {
                if (target > arr[mid] && target <= arr[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;  // Search in the right half
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;  // Search in the left half
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;  // Return -1 if target is not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {15, 19, 20, 25, 1, 5, 7};
        int target = 5;
        int result = searchInRotatedArray(arr, target);
        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element not found");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Element found at index: 5
```

### **Conclusion**

- **Linear Search** is simple but inefficient for large arrays.
- **Binary Search** is much more efficient for sorted arrays.
- **Modified Binary Search** is useful for cases where the array is rotated or when there are other special conditions.
